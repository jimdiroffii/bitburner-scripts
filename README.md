# bitburner-scripts

A collection of bitburner scripts that I used to play the game.

The initial project template is build on bitburner official typescript template which includes the remote API feature. This allows directly working with bitburner's API from your local IDE.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
Run `npm run watch` to open the API connection.

The default port is set to `12525`.

Open the game options, set the API port and click on the `Connect` button.

Additional documentation on the template can be found [on the official repository](https://github.com/bitburner-official/typescript-template).
